    <h1>Seizure Awareness</h1>
    <hr>
    <P>Psychogenic nonepileptic seisures, or PNES can resemble an epileptic seizure. Around 20-49% of patients being treated for epilepsy have PNES. PNES can be caused by Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Depression, chronic pain, and many other stressors. It can be hard to differentiate between epilepsy and PNES and can require a number of tests. One of the tests used is an EEG (electroencephalogram). This test records the electrical signals of your brain. During an epileptic seizure there is abnoral elextrical brain activity. PNES does not have this. Treatment of PNES consists of psychotherapies to learn triggers and techniques to help contol and manage seizures. In some cases medications may be used to manage the underlying cause of the seizures such as depression.</P>

    <h2>What to look for.</h2>
    <p>"What does a seizure look like? Someone who is having a seizure might have a full body convulsion called a tonic-clonic seizure while others have an absence seizure which is a brief laspe in awareness. No matter the type you should be on the look out for anything abnormal such as; convulsing, rapid eye movement, jerky limbs, unresponsiveness, and a change in patterns of movement. If think someone may be having a seizure it is important to help them sit or lay down (preferrably on their side) so that they are unable to hurt themselves or others."</p>
