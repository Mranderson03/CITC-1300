                <h3>Ways dogs can help</h3>
               <p>Many disabilities can benefits from the use of a service dog. Someone blind or with impaired vision would have a dog to help them cross streets or to get around obstacles. They might also retrieve objects for them. Someone with mobility issues might benefit from a dog that can help lean against them much like a cane and help retrieve objects. People with Type 1 diabetes can have a dog that can actually sense when their blood sugar is too high or low and can alert the owner. There is a dog for almost every type of disbility out there, all you need to do is ask.</p>

                <h3>Most common breeds</h3>
                <p>Every type of dog (and other animal) is used as a service dog. Labrador Retrievers are the most commonly used.
