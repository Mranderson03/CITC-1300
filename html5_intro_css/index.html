            <h3>What is a service dog?</h3>
            <p>Service dogs are so much more than pets. These dogs have been trained to serve their owners in a variety of roles. They can aid their humans in tasks like picking up dropped items, fetching medications, medical alerts, guding them across the street, and so many other tasks. Today there are around 500,000 service dogs in the United States. Service dogs are not to be confused with an emotional support animal. Service dogs are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Therefore these animals are allowed to be in all public spaces with their owners. </p>
