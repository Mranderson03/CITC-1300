            <h3>The Process</h3>
            <p>You might find yourself in need of a service dog and say "How do I get one?". It can be a long process. The first step is to talk to your doctor and see if they feel you would benefit from having a service dog. If you don't get approval from your doctor it can make the process a lot harder, but not impossibe. Next you would need to find a non-profit or charity that provides service dogs or find a professional trainer that trains for your needs. Another option would be to train the dog yourself, but in some cases this is not ideal depending on the disability.</p>

            <h3>Afordability </h3>
            <p>As you can imagine, a service dog is not cheap. Service dogs cost anywhere between $10,000 up to $50,000 or more. You can of course train them yourself through online courses which is the cheapest option. This might not be feasable for all because of the time required. Other options include filing a claim with insurance, applying for grants, fundraising, or taking out a personal loan. Try to keep in mind you are not buying a "pet", but an animal hand picked and trained to perform certain tasks to make your life easier and more comfortable. Explore your options and decide what is best for you.
